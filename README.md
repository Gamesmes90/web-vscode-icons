# web-vscode-icons (Minimal)
Vscode icons for github, gitlab, sourceforge and gitea

Inspired by [github-vscode-icons](github-vscode-icons), this extensions adds some bug fixes and new features.

This version has no options menu and no custom entries (to get your custom gitlab/gitea entry you must modify the matches entry in the manifest file and compile it)

Favicons are from [the original project](https://github.com/dderevjanik/github-vscode-icons)

## Features

- [x] GitHub
- [x] GitHub Directory
- [x] GitLab
- [x] GitLab Directory
- [x] SourceForge
- [x] Gitea
- [x] Gitea Directory

## Bug fixes
- Fixed Gitlab [thanks to this fork](https://github.com/jefersonla/github-vscode-icons)
- Fixed some icons

### Important note about vscode-icons-js
The original npm package lacks a couple of extensions, for this reason to compile the program it's better to manually install [this fork](https://github.com/Gamesmes90/vscode-icons-js) or else some files icons will be missing.
